            <p>Here’s a little known fact about me: I love jewelry. I feel wearing the right accessory can bring your outfit to the next level. I’m a big fan of rings, necklaces, earrings (even if I don’t wear them) the whole nine yards. Unfortunately, jewelry is a smoking hot business right now. That means prices for a simple ring set can be well over $30. As a college kid with nearly $10 in my bank account, that’s a no go. Which is why I was so excited to find this company. Lovisa is a jewelry company that has retail stores around various parts of the lovely globe 
                we live on. I come from a small city-if you can even call it that-that only had the stores like Macy’s and JCPenney in it’s one mall. Therefore, I had never heard of Lovisa before a couple weeks ago, despite their success in the retail world. I found their website through Instagram (I’m a Gen-Z kid, don’t judge) and immediately fell in love with their items. Shopping with my family is interesting to most people-we hardly ever buy things for full price. There either has to be a sale, or the cute shirt was on the clearance rack. And I’ve just gotten used to shopping that way. So, when I went to Lovisa’s site, naturally the first thing I did was click on the sale tab. Let me tell you something about this company: when they put something on sale, they don’t just knock off a couple dollars. They had $12 items for only three or four bucks. I was seriously impressed-and of course began stocking my cart. I’m not really a flashy person so despite their wide selection of products, I mostly stuck to the simple thin metal rings.</p>
