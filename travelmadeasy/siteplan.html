      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wanted to buy something online but don’t know how good the quality is? Or you find a new or underground brand and want to support them, but because they’re new the don’t have any reviews. Do you really want to chance you spending money on something you’re not sure of? Don’t worry, I’ll do it for you. On the pages of my blog, you’ll find honest reviews of products from small businesses that I've purchased myself. If you think that my opinion is worth anything, you can use it in your decision making on whether you’ll buy that necklace for you Aunt Petunia. You’re welcome.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>

        If you’ve found this page, congrats! This is a self-made page, so I’m truly impresses you’re here. If you stay, then you must also be a shopaholic. (I’m not exactly sure if I should congratulate you on that.) Here on this page, you’ll find some of the most honest reviews on the internet. I’m not joking-I’m not getting paid, so I have no reason to make these up. Scroll on then to start the binge reading all the different things I’ve spent my money on and what I think of them. 
        You’re still on the home page? You must be like me-you need categories, right? Look no further, I’ve done the hard work and sorted all the different products I review into simple boxes. Now it’s up to you to decide what you want to read about today.

        <h3>Lovisa Review</h3>
      
Here’s a little known fact about me: I love jewelry. I feel wearing the right accessory can bring your outfit to the next level. I’m a big fan of rings, necklaces, earrings (even if I don’t wear them) the whole nine yards. Unfortunately, jewelry is a smoking hot business right now. That means prices for a simple ring set can be well over $30. As a college kid with nearly $10 in my bank account, that’s a no go. Which is why I was so excited to find this company. 
Lovisa is a jewelry company that has retail stores around various parts of the lovely globe we live on. I come from a small city-if you can even call it that-that only had the stores like Macy’s and JCPenney in it’s one mall. Therefore, I had never heard of Lovisa before a couple weeks ago, despite their success in the retail world. I found their website through Instagram (I’m a Gen-Z kid, don’t judge) and immediately fell in love with their items. Shopping with my family is interesting to most people-we hardly ever buy things for full price. There either has to be a sale, or the cute shirt was on the clearance rack. And I’ve just gotten used to shopping that way. So, when I went to Lovisa’s site, naturally the first thing I did was click on the sale tab. Let me tell you something about this company: when they put something on sale, they don’t just knock off a couple dollars. They had $12 items for only three or four bucks. I was seriously impressed-and of course began stocking my cart. 
I’m not really a flashy person so despite their wide selection of products, I mostly stuck to the simple thin metal rings.

      <h3>Read About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi everyone! My name is Alexis. I started this blog mostly because I needed to do an assignment for one of my classes. While that was the big push for making this site, I’d had the idea of it swimming in my head forever (or more realistically around 5 months). I do have a credit card and a dangerous addiction to typing in the numbers. I’ve always loved discovering and supporting small businesses and giving them some much need clout. If I’m not doing my homework (or crying over said homework) you can find me online trying to justify another purchase. If you think that my opinion is worth anything, you can use it in your decision making on whether you’ll buy that necklace for you Aunt Petunia. You’re welcome.

      <h3>Credit is due</h3>
      <p>I wanted give credit to my friends over at flaticon.com for the super awesome icons. I’m not artistic at all so the fact that people who are willingly gave their creations to less fortunate people like me is a lifesaver. Really, someone should give them a puppy or something. Alas, I have absolutely no money to buy a puppy and tracking down all those people would be a little difficult. So, without further puff-upery, credits…
