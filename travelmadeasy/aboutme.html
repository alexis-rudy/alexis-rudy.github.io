        <p class="ab-content">Hi everyone! My name is Alexis. I started this blog mostly because I needed to do an assignment for one of my classes. While that was the big push for making this site, I’d had the idea of it swimming in my head forever (or more realistically around 5 months). I do have a credit card and a dangerous addiction to typing in the numbers. I’ve always loved discovering and supporting small businesses and giving them some much need clout. If I’m not doing my homework (or crying over said homework) you can find me online trying to justify another purchase. If you think that my opinion is worth anything, you can use it in your decision making on whether you’ll buy that necklace for you Aunt Petunia. You’re welcome.</p>
        <h2>Credit is Due</h2>
        <p class="ab-content">I wanted give credit to my friends over at flaticon.com for the super awesome icons. I’m not artistic at all so the fact that people who are willingly gave their creations to less fortunate people like me is a lifesaver. Really, someone should give them a puppy or something. Alas, I have absolutely no money to buy a puppy and tracking down all those people would be a little difficult. So, without further puff-upery, credits…
