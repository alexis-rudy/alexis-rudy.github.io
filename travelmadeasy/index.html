                <p>If you’ve found this page, congrats! This is a self-made page, so I’m truly impressed you’re here. If you stay, then you must also be a shopaholic. (I’m not exactly sure if I should congratulate you on that.) Here on this page, you’ll find some of the most honest reviews on the internet. I’m not joking-I’m not getting paid, so I have no reason to make these up. Click on then to start the binge reading all the different things I’ve spent my money on and what I think of them.</p>
